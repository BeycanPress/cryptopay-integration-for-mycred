## Cryptocurrency Payment Gateway and Withdrawal for myCred by CryptoPay

### What does this plugin do?

As you know, myCred is a gamification plugin that allows users to collect points with their actions on your WordPress website. It has many features and also integrates with many different plugins.

Our integration plugin allows you to use the CryptoPay payment gateway for buyCred and cashCred in myCred.

### How does it work?

First of all, you must have either the Lite or Premium version of CryptoPay. Because this is an integration plugin. And you also need to have myCred installed, of course. Once you have CryptoPay activated, you need to go to your myCred settings in the buyCred and cashCred payment gateways area and activate CryptoPay.

As you can see in the pictures, you can then start receiving crypto payments directly with myCred. You can also pay your users with cryptocurrency.
